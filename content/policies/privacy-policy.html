        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>
            At <strong>Shreekama Foundation</strong>, we are committed to protecting the privacy and personal information of our donors, volunteers, beneficiaries, and visitors. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and share information when you interact with our website, participate in our programs, make a donation, or otherwise engage with our organization.
        </p>

        <p>
            By accessing our website or submitting information to us, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shreekama Foundation collects information to operate effectively, improve user experience, and fulfil our humanitarian mission. This may include personal details such as your name, contact information, email address, donation-related information, and any communication or details voluntarily submitted by you. In some situations—such as issuing tax receipts or complying with government regulations—we may request identity or documentation as required by Indian laws.
        </p>

        <p>
            When donations are made digitally, payment details may be processed by secure, approved third-party payment gateways. Shreekama Foundation does not store full payment card numbers, CVV codes, or sensitive banking details on its servers.
        </p>

        <p>
            We may collect non-personal information such as browser type, device information, IP address, and website usage analytics to improve our website experience. Cookies or similar technologies may be used to support personalization, security, or technical functioning. You may disable cookies through your browser settings; however, certain features may function differently.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your personal information is used solely for legitimate purposes such as processing donations, issuing receipts, sharing updates, coordinating volunteer programs, responding to inquiries, maintaining legal compliance, and improving our services. We do not sell, trade, or rent personal information to any individual or commercial entity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Information may be shared with trusted third parties only when required—for example, technology providers, government bodies, audit authorities, or payment platforms—strictly for operational purposes, compliance, or legal requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shreekama Foundation follows reasonable administrative, digital, and physical safeguards to protect collected data. However, no method of electronic transmission is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection against cyber risks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our website may contain external links to partner organizations, platforms, or informational resources. We are not responsible for their practices, security, or content. Users are encouraged to review external privacy policies before interacting with them.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may contact us to request access, correction, withdrawal of consent, or deletion of your personal information where legally applicable. Certain information may be retained for tax, legal, auditing, or reporting obligations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shreekama Foundation may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect organizational or legal changes. Continued use of our website and services after updates implies acceptance of the revised policy.
        </p>
