        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>Shreekama Foundation</strong>. By accessing our website, participating in our programs,
            engaging as a donor or volunteer, or using any services offered through our digital platforms, you agree to comply
            with these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully, as they establish the legal responsibilities between you
            and Shreekama Foundation. If you do not agree with these terms, you may discontinue the use of our services.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shreekama Foundation is a non-profit organization working towards social welfare, empowerment, development, and
            humanitarian causes in alignment with applicable Indian laws. The information shared on our website and communication
            channels is intended for general awareness, transparency, and engagement. While we make continuous efforts to ensure
            accuracy, we do not guarantee that all information published will always be complete, current, or error-free.
        </p>

        <p>
            Use of our website and services must be lawful and respectful. Users must not attempt unauthorized access to our
            systems, post harmful or misleading content, engage in fraudulent activity, misrepresent identities, or misuse our
            platform in any way. We reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to anyone found violating these terms.
        </p>

        <p>
            Donations made to Shreekama Foundation are voluntary and support our mission. Once processed, donations are generally
            non-refundable; however, in cases of accidental duplicate payments or verified technical errors, refund requests may
            be reviewed. Where applicable, donors may receive a receipt and tax exemption certificate as permitted under relevant
            registration and tax laws, provided the necessary donor information is furnished accurately. Shreekama Foundation does
            not store complete payment card numbers, CVV codes, or sensitive banking details—payments may be processed through secure,
            trusted third-party platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
            Participation in volunteer activities or programs requires responsible conduct. Volunteers agree to follow instructions,
            maintain confidentiality when necessary, and respect organizational guidelines. Shreekama Foundation may terminate volunteer
            or participant involvement if conduct is deemed harmful, unsafe, or inconsistent with organizational values.
        </p>

        <p>
            All text, media, graphics, logos, and materials appearing on our website belong to Shreekama Foundation unless otherwise stated.
            No individual or entity may reproduce, modify, distribute, or use our name, logo, or content for unauthorized, personal, or
            commercial purposes without written permission.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our website may contain external links to partner organizations, platforms, or informational resources. These links are shared
            for reference or collaboration, and Shreekama Foundation is not responsible for the accuracy, privacy practices, or content
            published on external websites.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your use of our services is also subject to our Privacy Policy, which explains how personal data is collected, processed, and protected.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shreekama Foundation, its trustees, staff, directors, volunteers, or associates will not be held responsible for indirect or
            consequential losses arising from website use, technical interruptions, reliance on information, or services offered. All access
            to our platform is provided on an <strong>"as available" and "as is"</strong> basis.
        </p>

        <p>
            We may update these Terms of Service occasionally to reflect organizational or legal changes. Continued use of the website and
            services after updates implies acceptance of the revised policy.
