# Shreekama Foundation - Website Maintenance Manual

This website is a **Static HTML/CSS/JS** site. It does not require a complex build process (like React/Webpack) and can be hosted simply by uploading these files to any server (GitHub Pages, Netlify, GoDaddy, etc.).

## 📂 Folder Structure

We have organized the files to keep maintenance easy.

*   `root` (Main Folder)
    *   `index.html`: Home page.
    *   `about.html`, `contact.html`, etc.: Main site pages.
    *   `css/`: Contains `styles.css` for custom styling.
    *   `js/`: Contains the logic.
        *   `script.js`: Controls the header, footer, mobile menu, and page logic.
        *   `data.js`: **Central Database**. Update content here.
    *   `assets/`: Store your images here.
        *   `assets/images/`: Place your team photos, event photos, etc. here.
    *   `policies/`: (Optional) Can store PDF policies or extra documents.
        *   *Note*: The Privacy Policy page is currently `privacy-policy.html` in the root for easier linking.

## 🛠 How to Update Content

You do **not** need to edit the HTML files for most updates. Most content is stored in `js/data.js`.

### 1. Updating Programs
Open `js/data.js` and find `PROGRAMS_DATA`.
*   To add a program, copy an existing `{ block }` and change the title, description, and image URL.
*   The `slug` must be unique (e.g., `'new-program-name'`).

### 2. Updating Blog Posts
Open `js/data.js` and find `BLOG_POSTS_DATA`.
*   Add a new object to the list.
*   **Content**: You can use basic HTML tags inside the `content` field (like `<p>`, `<b>`, `<blockquote>`).

### 3. Updating Team Members
Open `js/data.js` and find `TEAM_DATA`.
*   Change names, roles, or image paths.

### 4. Updating Events
Open `js/data.js` and find `EVENTS_DATA`.
*   To move an event to "Past Events", simply set `isPast: true`.

### 5. Replacing Images
1.  Save your new image in the `assets/images/` folder.
2.  In `js/data.js`, update the `imageUrl` property.
    *   Example: `imageUrl: 'assets/images/my-new-photo.jpg'`

## 📝 Editing Forms

The forms (Donation, Volunteer, Contact) are in their respective HTML files (`donate.html`, `volunteer.html`, `contact.html`).

*   **Webhooks**: The forms are connected to Make.com via the `data-webhook-url` attribute on the `<form>` tag.
    *   To change the destination, simply replace that URL.
*   **New Fields**: If you add an `<input name="newData">`, it will automatically be sent to the webhook.

## 🎨 Styling

The site uses **Tailwind CSS** (loaded via CDN for simplicity).
*   To change colors or spacing, edit the class names in the HTML files (e.g., `text-red-500`, `pt-10`).
*   Global custom styles are in `css/styles.css`.

## 🚀 Deployment

Since this is a static site:
1.  **GitHub Pages**: Push code to GitHub, go to Settings -> Pages, and select the `main` branch.
2.  **Standard Hosting**: Upload all files to your `public_html` folder via FTP.
